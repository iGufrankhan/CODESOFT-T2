 This C++ program implements a simple calculator using a do-while loop for continuous operation based on user input. 
 It begins by displaying a loading message and prompts the user to enter two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /).
  It then performs the corresponding operation based on the operator chosen using a switch-case statement. 
  If division by zero is attempted, it displays an error message. 
  After each operation, it prompts the user to continue or exit.
   If the user chooses to continue (enters 1), the loop repeats; 
   otherwise (enters 0),the program exits with a thank you message.
The program ensures user interaction through clear prompts and outputs results with appropriate formatting.
                      that's it .
 It is a simple program to perform diffeerent operation which is used in simple calculator.
                      
                      Thank you.
